I'm a Quantitative Researcher at Citadel's Global Quantitative Strategies team in New York.
Previously, I completed my PhD in Professor Stephen Boydâ€™s group at Stanford, where my research focused on convex optimization applied to quantitative finance. Before Stanford, I was a research fellow at Harvard and a research intern at Caltech. I hold a BSc in Physics and an MSc in Machine Learning, both from KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.
