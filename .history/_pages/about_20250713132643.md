I'm a quantiative researcher at Citadel Quant PhD student in Prof. Stephen Boyd's group at Stanford. My current
research is on convex optimization applied to quantitative finance. Prior
to joining Stanford I was a research fellow at Harvard, and prior to that a
research intern at Caltech. I received a BSc in Physics and an MSc in Machine
Learning, both from KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.
